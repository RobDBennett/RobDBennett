### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


:dragon_face: Hi everyone! I am a Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer who is currently wrapping up their time at @LambdaSchool. 
I am now searching the :earth_americas: (more specifically Seattle/WA) for exciting job opportunities that will specifically allow me to work with brilliant individuals at a daring tech company. I am completely enamoured with artificial intelligence, machine learning, evolutionary biology and the Theory of Mind. I relish every opportunity to read more philosophy regarding intelligence and the nature of thought.

:back: Before signing up for Lambda to pursue a career in engineering I was a master of hospitality for many years. My father was a chef, and I got my start there early. I've spent years as a sommelier,  chef, manager, and director. I also build, manage and run large scale LARP events in my spare time.

:calling: Please reach out if you want to discuss ideas, code, startups or you are interested in working with me.
